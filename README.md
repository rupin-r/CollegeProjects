# CollegeProjects
A compilation of college projects I have worked on individually or as part of a team and am allowed to release without the possibility of academic disintegrity at University at Buffalo.

Additional projects I have worked on, but can't add to this repository for academic integrity purposes are:

* VLSI design using Cadence Virtuoso for an automated Cruise Control System

* Pruning and Quantization of a Neural Network

* Neural Architecture Search

* 8 bit MIPS processor in Verilog programmed to Basys FPGA

* Traffic Light System implemented with hardware and SystemVerilog

* Hamming Code using MIPS assembly

* Atari Breakout using ARM assembly on the TIVA C Series

* Open world game in Unreal was also too big to place in this repository
