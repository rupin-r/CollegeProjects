# CollegeProjects
A compilation of college projects I have worked on individually or as part of a team and am allowed to release without the possibility of academic disintegrity at University at Buffalo.

Additional projects I have worked on, but can't add to this repository for academic integrity purposes are:

Cash Register Application

Traffic Light System implemented with hardware and SystemVerilog

An 8 bit MIPS processor using Verilog (in Xilinx Vivado) and programmed onto BASYS FPGA

Atari Breakout using ARM assembly on the TIVA C Series

Dance Dance Revolution using ARM assembly on the TIVA C Series and some C for music handling and initial file reading
  
  This will be used as the project to implement for students taking Microprocessors I next year

Hamming Code using MIPS assembly

A VLSI design using Cadence for an automated Cruise Control System
