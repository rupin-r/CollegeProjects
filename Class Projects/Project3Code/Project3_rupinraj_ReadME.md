Project Description: C++ projects that implement several inputs and outputs to create an autonomous vehicle

--------------------
Features
--------------------

Includes several different files that show working progress towards the final solution incorporating a matrix keypad, an LCD display, a matrix dot display, IR sensors,
and motors.

The main code solution will allow a user to enter two values into the matrix keypad signifying the end x and y coordinate to travel to from a starting 0,0 position.
The vehicle will then disregard further user input and attempt to drive to the location without bumping into obstacles around it. It should also perform pathfinding with obstacles found in the way stored as nodes.

--------------------
Getting Started
--------------------

***Matrix Keypad***

Connect the ground rail to GND of the nucleo L4R5ZI. Connect pins E3 through E6 to the first four pins of the matrix keypad. Then, connect
pins D4 through D7 to the 4 different rails of the breadboard. Connect the last 4 pins of the matrix keypad in the same 4 rails, the first pin
corresponding to D4 and so on. With these two pins, connect the positive end of the LED in the same rails and the negative end to ground.
Run the program to see the column of the button you pressed light up as well as the value printed to the screen.

***LCD***

Connect the VCC pin of the LCD to the 5V pin on the nucleo L4R5ZI. Connect the GND pin on the LCD to GND. Connect the SDA pin on the LCD to PB_9
and the SCL to PB_8. Run the program. Adjust the contrast potentiometer on the LCD until the phrase "Hello World" shows up on the screen.

***IR Sensor***

Connect the IR sensors pin VCC to 5V on the nucleo L4R5ZI and the ground pin to GND. Connect the Out pin of the IR sensor to PD_0. Connect PD_1 of the nucleo to the positive edge of a breadboarded LED. The negative edge should go to the second GND on the nucleo. Run the program and the breadboarded LED will light up if the IR
sensor detects an obstacle. Adjust the IR sensor distance with the potentiometer on top of the sensor.

***Matrix Dot Display***

Connect the VCC pin of the max 7219 to the 3V3 pin of the nucleo L4R5ZI and the GND pin to ground. Then, connect the cs pin of the max 7219 to PC_10, connect the clk pin to PC_9, and the din pin to PC_8. Run the program and something like a Pacman red ghost should appear on the matrix dot display. If the display doesn't appear, try changing the VCC to 5V instead of 3V3.

***Building the Chassis***

The base of the chassis will be the cardboard material. The requirements of the cardboard structure must be that it can hold the nucleo, the breadboard, and all three servos. Two of the servos will go out the sides, so the minimum height of the chassis is the sum of the breadboard, the nucleo, the width of a motor, and the height of a motor. The minimum length should be the maximum distance of either the nucleo or the breadboard and the minimum width should be the sum of the width of the nucleo and the height of two motors. Using these general dimensions, a box should be constructed from the cardboard and it will be able to hold all the parts. For easy building, buying the motors and wheels from parallax provided a box that was the perfect size for construction.

Cut out a rectangle the exact size of the base of each motor on either side (the longer length side) of the cardboard box. These cutouts should be the exact same height and length away from each other or the vehicle won't drive straight. The exact location of these rectangles should be very close to the bottom, or at the bottom of the box and a little more than half of the length. At half length, the vehicle will tip while driving, so don't cut at exactly halfway. While not at halfway, the weight imbalance after placing all the componenets will keep the vehicle from tipping. Cut three sides of the top off so it forms a flap. Put the motors into the rectangle cutouts on the side such that the wires face the same direction going towards the back end of the box. This means to go straight, one motor will be going clockwise and the other going counterclockwise. Make sure your motors move very little after being placed inside these cutouts. If they move a lot, figure out how to make them stabilized. Then add wheels to these two motors.

Cut out a small, thin section, the size of the matrix keypad bus, on to the back top of the chassis. The matrix keypad bus will go through this section. The size doesn't matter as long as the wires will stay inside the vehicle. Cut out another rectangle shape, the same size as the two previous motors ones, but on the top of the chassis. Place the third motor into this slot with the wires going back again. Attach the cross shape piece to his motor and have one pin of the IR sensor go through one of the holes of this cross piece. Connect wires to the IR sensor and then heavily tape it down to the cross piece. It should be angled down slightly so it can see ahead of the vehicle, but not too far down so it only sees the vehicle. Cut one last piece from the top the size of just the bottom of the LCD display. The bottom will go through the top of the chassis while the rest will fall under so it can connect to the wires.

Finally, connect VCC to one red line of the breadboard, GND to the black line, 3V3 to the other red line, and the other GND to the other black line. Connect both the motors to the red line with VCC and the corresponding black line. Then have the left side motor input connection go to PB_6 while the right side goes to PA_3. Connect the four inputs of the matrix keypad to PE_3 through PE_6 in that order. Then connect the outputs to PD_4 through PD_7. Connect the LCD VCC to the 3V3 red line and the GND to the corresponding black line. Then connect SDA to PB_9 and SCL to PB_8. Lastly, connect the IR sensor VCC and GND to the 3V3 red line and its corresponding ground and connect the output signal to PD_0.

In order to seal everything in place the breadboard and nucleo inside the box, close the top flap, and tape it down once all the wire connections are made. If there are flaps in the front, tape those shut as well. Tape the matrix keypad down to the top of the chassis. Secure the LCD display on to the top. Use any other materials necessary to make sure all the motors are secured in place.

***Motors***

After building the chassis (directions above), run the program TestingMotors and your vehicle should move forward, turn right, then move backward and stop. If the left turn is not a 90 degree in place turn for your vehicle, adjust the values until it does. These values will need to be used in the main file. You can also adjust the PWM values to increase the distance traversed. The current distance traversed was the size of my vehicle. Changes made to this value should also be made to the main file.

***Main***

Make sure you complete the previous two test plans first before starting this one. Once you have determined the correct motor values, replace them in this file at both the beginning in the global variables and at the end in the event methods. Then run the program. Using 3,0 as input, the vehicle will drive straight forward 3 spaces and then stop. Running 3,0 again, if you place your hand in the way close to when it starts moving, it will move around your hand to positions 1,1 ; 2,1 ; 3,1 ; and then 3,0. Other input can be tried as well. The exception where the destination is blocked is not handled and should not be tested as it could break the vehicle.
